This section will document breaking changes between Micronaut 2.x and Micronaut 3.x

=== Nullability Annotations

Micronaut 2.4 introduced custom annotations for nullability declaration, api:core.annotation.NonNull[] and api:core.annotation.Nullable[]. The spotbugs annotations were also included on the classpath by default. Micronaut 3 will no longer include the spotbugs annotations as a dependency. The options for migration include adding an explicit dependency on spotbugs to the application, or using the Micronaut specific annotations.

=== Decapitalization Strategy

For many cases, one common one being introspections, getter names like `getXForwarded()` would result in the bean property being `XForwarded`. The name will now be `xForwarded`. This can affect many areas of the framework where names like `XForwarded` are used.
